// ways:
//
//   1. Persistent handle (Chromium): a `FileSystemDirectoryHandle` was stored
//      when the folder was first chosen. We revalidate read permission (which
//      needs a user gesture — the Resume click) and walk it.
//   2. Reselect-required (everywhere else, or revoked permission): the user
//      reselects the folder and we reconcile by relative path, size, and
//      SHA-256 before queuing the remaining work. We never claim to upload
//      bytes from a `localPath` string alone.
